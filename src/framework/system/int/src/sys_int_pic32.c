  Function:
    void SYS_INT_Initialize ( void )

  Summary:
    Configures and initializes the interrupt sub-system.

  Description:
    This function appropriately configures and initializes the interrupt sub-system
    for the current system design.

  Precondition:
    None.

  Parameters:
    None.

  Returns:
    None.

  Example:
  <code>
  SYS_INT_Initialize();
  </code>

  Remarks:
    This function is not implemented in the System Interrupt library.  It is
    implemented by the board support package (using the processor-specific
    interrupt peripheral library) because it requires knowledge of the specific
    interrupt requirements for each system.
